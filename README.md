# Todo List App – Vibe Coding Assignment

This project is part of a Software Development course assignment exploring the emerging paradigm of "vibe coding" — AI-assisted development workflows. The goal was to build a functional project using an AI coding assistant and reflect on the process.

In this project, I used **ChatGPT as an external vibe coding assistant** while developing inside Visual Studio Code. The app enables users to create, complete, and delete tasks, with browser persistence using localStorage.
